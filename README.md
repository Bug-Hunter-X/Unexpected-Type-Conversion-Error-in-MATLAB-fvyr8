# Unexpected Type Conversion Error in MATLAB
This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error in MATLAB related to implicit type conversion. The code includes a function `myFunction` which includes an error handling mechanism using `try-catch` statement. This example illustrates how MATLAB's flexibility with data types can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed. The solution shows how to add explicit type checking in `myFunction` to prevent the error.
